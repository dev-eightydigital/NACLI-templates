			<p>The Grassroots Heritage Roving Exhibition traces the story of the Grassroots Movement, People’s Association and Community Centres. Established before the birth of the nation, these entities are still performing its continuing role to forge closer people to people links and people with government connectivity.</p>

			<p>Specifically designed for schools and public institutions, including public libraries and community centres/clubs, the series carries key messages of social cohesion and racial harmony in our nation building journey. With fixed and interactive panels and programming for better engagement with students, the exhibition aims to connect them emotionally with serving the community and advancing Singapore.</p>

			<p>The learning outcome for the students is the realization that Singapore is our home and it is everyone’s responsibility to maintain, defend and develop it. The entire roving exhibition package, including curating to students, is complimentary.</p>
