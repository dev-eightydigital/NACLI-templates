			<p>Opened on 4 October 2003, the Grassroots Heritage Centre (GHC) is set up by NACLI as part of the People's Association's (PA) long term National Education efforts for its staff and grassroots leaders. Showcasing four decades of community development milestones, the GHC traces the growth of the PA and its grassroots organisations through historical accounts, pictures, audio reels, exhibits and artefacts. The centre also features a mock up of a 60s community centre.</p>
