			<p>The Friends of GHC are experienced and passionate Grassroots Leaders who have a good understanding of the grassroots movement and its key roles.  The Friends of GHC volunteer their services to curate the heritage of grassroots to the community, to youths and to fellow grassroots leaders at the GHC.</p>

			<p>In order to increase the outreach of the GHC, a few sets of Grassroots Heritage Roving Exhibition (GHRE) have been developed and roved to schools and community events.  To prepare for an increased visit to the GHC and increased outreach through the GHRE, more volunteers will be needed to curate and support the programming efforts to inspire more people and youth about the grassroots and its continuing role in serving our community.</p>
