			<p>Finely sculptured in glowing copper tone, the stylised NACLI signifies quality, professionalism, stature and progressiveness.</p>

			<p>Copper, a malleable metal, reflects the Institute’s moulding and grooming work. As an excellent conductor, it also symbolises connectedness and communication.</p>

			<p>The letter “A” with an inverted triangle depicts the synergy of ideas which embodies a bottom-up approach.</p>

			<p>The letter "I" in lower case represents the individual leader the Institute develops to be in service of the community. The circle in the letter 'i' symbolises our leaders engaging in continuous learning and collective action as they build and bond the community.</p>
